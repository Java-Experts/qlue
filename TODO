To Do

- Persistent pages: Support multiple command objects per page; choose one that matches page's state.

  - In this case, don't examine the state of individual parameters.

- Persistent pages: Support more than one onPost() method based on a parameter, say "_cmd". Detect
  presence of the command parameter and automatically invoke the correct method, say onPost_something().
  The idea here is web applications are becoming smarter. In most situations state can be kept in the
  browser and pages invoked only when an action is required. In some cases it might be needed to
  keep some of the state on the server (e.g., file uploads). Then, the application could (from JavaScript)
  create a new persistent page, then invoke various actions on it, and then "commit" at the end.

  - Should be an option to destroy a persistent page.

  - Page state could be taken into account for onPost() sub-routing.
