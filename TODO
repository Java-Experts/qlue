To Do
----- 
 
- XXX Detect multiple conflicting _pid parameters.

- Register custom Velocity directives:

  - http://wiki.apache.org/velocity/CheckingForNull
  	- #ifnull
  	- #ifnotnull

- Remove dependency on Apache Commons FileUpload.

- Move logging to SLF4J.

- Move build to Gradle.

- Routing: Process .vmx files directly when page class not available

- JsonEditor to convert JSON into Java objects. Indicate via annotation?

- Feature to invoke Java Bean validation afterward Qlue validation? See http://hibernate.org/validator/

- API call to shut down the scheduler.

- API call to check if there are any scheduled activities running.

- Response header control:

  - In Qlue configuration, support custom response headers: qlue.headers.cache-control=XYZ

  - Custom headers above set before routing begins.


Improvements
------------

- Debugging output: use reflection to print out object contents where it makes sense.

- Keep a copy of all admin emails somewhere (on the filesystem).

- Add AsyncEmailSender backed by filesystem.

- When behind a trusted proxy, record the supplied unique ID (which is transported in a header).

- Session handling:

  - Use very long sessions, practically disabling the underlying expiration mechanism.
  
  - Periodically rotate session IDs
  
  - Asks users to re-authenticate in regular intervals (that will also rotate their session IDs)
  
  - Leave it to the underlying session storage mechanism to remove sessions when it
    runs out of storage space
    
  - Perhaps feel free to collect sessions that do not have any active processes

- Routing: Add support for string interpolation on the right-hand side. Use case:
  redirect to a different URL, using some of the regex captures. Be careful about
  URL re-encoding issues.

- Routing: Add support for programmatic route manipulation

- Users should be able to create private instances of MimeTypes, they should be able to
  tell the framework to use another mime type, and/or to override the settings

- Routing: control resource caching from the routing configuration.

- Binding: Add support for validation of fixed-value fields (e.g.,
  drop-down boxes). Provide list to Qlue.

- Scheduler improvements:

  - Jobs can be marked "important". That means if the job doesn't run at the required
    time for whatever reason (e.g., the application is down), it is run at the next
    possible opportunity.

  - Jobs can be assigned tags and there is per-tag concurrency control. For example,
    you might want to mark database jobs with a "db" tag and state that only one such
    job can be running at one time.

  - If a job is running, another instance of the same job is not started.

  - Job failures are an application event, cause admin notification, etc.
